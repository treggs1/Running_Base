                Heart rate zones are a way to measure the intensity of your workout by monitoring your heart rate. Your
                heart rate is an important indicator of how hard your body is working during exercise, and it can help
                you determine whether you're working at an appropriate level to achieve your fitness goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are five different heart rate zones, each with its own level of intensity and corresponding
                percentage of your maximum heart rate. These zones range from low-intensity recovery workouts to
                maximum-effort, high-intensity intervals. A well-rounded workout plan should include exercises in
                multiple zones, with varying durations and frequencies, in order to challenge your body in different
                ways and promote overall fitness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding heart rate zones can be especially helpful when planning workouts for specific fitness
                goals, such as weight loss or endurance training. By training in specific heart rate zones, you can
                target different aspects of fitness and improve your overall health.
            </p>
            <h2 id="zone1">ZONE 1: 50-60%</h2>
            <p>
                This is the lowest intensity zone, and it is ideal for beginners or those who are recovering from a
                workout. Training at this intensity can help boost your recovery and prepare you for more intense
                workouts. Exercises such as walking or cycling can be effective for training in this zone. It
                strengthens your heart and reduces body fat, cholesterol, and blood pressure, but does not improve
                endurance or strength.
            </p>
            <h2 id="zone2">ZONE 2: 60-70%</h2>
            <p>
                Exercising in this zone is still relatively low-intensity, but you should be able to go on for a long
                time. It improves your general endurance and makes your body better at burning fat and increasing
                capillary density. This zone is an essential part of any exercise program, and the benefits will become
                apparent over time. Activities such as slow to medium-paced exercise can be effective for training in
                this zone.
            </p>
            <h2 id="zone3">ZONE 3: 70-80%</h2>
            <p>
                This zone is more intense and can be effective for improving the efficiency of blood circulation in the
                heart and skeletal muscles. It's also great for burning fat, strengthening muscles, and improving
                general fitness. You'll be breathing harder in this zone, and lactic acid will begin to build up in your
                bloodstream. Activities such as moderate efforts are recommended for training in this zone.
            </p>
            <h2 id="zone4">ZONE 4: 80-90% </h2>
            <p>
                Training in this zone is tough, and you'll be breathing hard and working aerobically. Your body will get
                better at using carbohydrates for energy, and you'll be able to withstand higher levels of lactic acid
                in your blood for longer. This zone is great for improving endurance and general fitness, but it's
                recommended for short spurts only 2 or 3 days per week. Breathing will be laboured, and this zone is not
                suitable for beginners.
            </p>
            <h2 id="zone5">ZONE 5: 90-100%</h2>
            <p>
                This is the maximal effort zone, and it's not suitable for beginners or those who have only been
                training for a short time. Your heart, blood, and respiratory system will be working at their maximal
                capacity, and lactic acid will build up in your blood. This zone is only recommended for short bursts of
                1 or 2 minutes and can be effective for improving athletic performance. However, there is a high risk of
                injury, so stay away from this zone unless you're a competitive athlete.
            </p>
            <p>
                To determine your heart rate zones, you need to know your maximum heart rate, which can be calculated
                based on your age and other factors. Once you have your maximum heart rate, you can use it to calculate
                the appropriate target heart rate range for each zone.
            </p>
            <p>
                By incorporating heart rate zones into your workout routine, you can ensure that you're working at the
                appropriate level of intensity for your fitness goals and maximize the benefits of your workouts.
