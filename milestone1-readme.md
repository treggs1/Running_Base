# Running Base

The Running Base website has been created to provide comprehensive information to beginner and inexperienced runners on building their base fitness for running. Additionally, the website offers valuable insights to more experienced runners who may be struggling to make further progress in their running training. Over time, the website will be expanded to include more advanced running programs and resources. Designed with full responsiveness and accessibility in mind, the website ensures optimal user experience for all visitors.

## Design

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed design section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022#Design)

### Colour Scheme

Add all information about your colour scheme for your site here. You can explain why you choose the colours you did?

I like to include a palette of the colour scheme here, my favourite site for creating a colour palette is [coolors](https://coolors.co/), but there are lots of other sites that also do the same thing, like [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23F5F5F5&sub=1), [Muzli Colors](https://colors.muz.li/), [Adobe Colour Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) to name a few.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

* Orbitron is used for logo in the header on the site. It is a sans-serif font.
* Quicksand is used for all other text and headings on the site. It is a sans-serif font.
* sans-serif was used as a backup if the fonts can not be loaded from Google Fonts.

### Imagery

A stock image from [heroimages.com](https://heroimages.com/) was used for the hero image.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were made using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). I opted not to create wireframes for each page on all devices instead, I designed wireframes for three different pages on three distinct devices, with the main content section being the only element that varies across each page to maintain consistency across the site.

#### Mobile wireframe

#### Tablet wireframe

## Features

The pages of the website are as follows:

- Home page
- Building your base page
- Heart rate zones page
- Heart rate zone calculator page
- Contact us page 
- Confirmation page that redirects user to homepage after submitting contact form.

### Existing Features

- **Feature #1 Navbar**

- The navigation bar is prominently displayed at the top of every page, featuring the website's logo/brand name as well as quick links to every page for convenient and accessible browsing.

- **Feature #2 Navbar mobile toggler**

- The mobile navbar toggler simplifies the navbar for small devices by collapsing it into a menu button. Clicking the button opens a list of website pages for easier navigation. This provides a cleaner design while still giving users all the necessary navigation options. Clicking the icon toggles the menu between its open and cloased states.

- **Feature #3 Hero image with cover text**

- The site's tagline is used as the cover text over the hero image on the homepage. On most other pages, the page title is used - except on the contact form confirmation page, where it is used to confirm the message was sent and to inform the user that they will be redirected to homepage shortly.

- The footer includes copyright information and social links for easy access to our social media.

**Feature #5 Contact form**

- A basic contact form for the user to contact us. (all fields are required)

![screenshot](/assets/readme/feature-contact-form.png)

**Feature #6 Heart rate zone calculator**

- The heart rate zone calculator requires the user to input either their age or for more accuracy and if known their max heart rate it will then tell them the heart rate ranges they should be in for each training zone.

**Feature #6 Confirmation page**

- Confirm the message was sent and informs the user that they will be redirected to homepage.

### Future Implementations

The first thing that would be added to the website when deployed on a live server would be a blog I would of impplemented this already but as github pages doesn't support php this wasn't possible at this time. The blog would be used for more advanced training plans, information about running gear and different types of running

### Accessibility

I have made every effort to increase the accessibility of the website. I have incorporated various features such as aria-labels for social media icons to enable easy use of screen readers by all individuals. Additionally, I have added a span over the hero background image to enable screen readers to provide a comprehensive description of the content. To ensure further accessibility, I have used semantic HTML throughout the website.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.


## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)


## Credits

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

### ¬†Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
### ¬†Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
