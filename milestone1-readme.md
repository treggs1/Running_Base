# Running Base

The Running Base website has been created to provide comprehensive information to beginner and inexperienced runners on building their base fitness for running. Additionally, the website offers valuable insights to more experienced runners who may be struggling to make further progress in their running training. Over time, the website will be expanded to include more advanced running programs and resources. Designed with full responsiveness and accessibility in mind, the website ensures optimal user experience for all visitors.

## User Experience (UX)

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#user-experience-ux)

### User Stories

Add your user stories here. You want to include first time visitors and returning visitors here as a minimum. Think about each group, and the experience and journey you want them to have on your site. It really helps to think about this before you start coding, and will really help with creating your wireframes.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* I want to be able to easily understand what the site is about.
* I want to be able to find the information I need and navigate to it quickly.
* I want to be able to find social madia links easily.
* As a beginner, I want to learn how to run properly.
* I want to improve my running skills and get faster.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

* I want to quickly get back to the information I need with minimal clicks.
* I want to be able to contact Running Base to ask for aditional information if needed.

## Design

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed design section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022#Design)

### Colour Scheme

Add all information about your colour scheme for your site here. You can explain why you choose the colours you did?

I like to include a palette of the colour scheme here, my favourite site for creating a colour palette is [coolors](https://coolors.co/), but there are lots of other sites that also do the same thing, like [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23F5F5F5&sub=1), [Muzli Colors](https://colors.muz.li/), [Adobe Colour Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) to name a few.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

* Orbitron is used for logo in the header on the site. It is a sans-serif font.
* Quicksand is used for all text and headings on the site. It is a sans-serif font.

### Imagery

Use this section to explain what sort of imagery you plan to use through your site.

### Wireframes

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

There are lots of different options to create your wireframes - Code Institute students can access [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as part of the course.

Some other options include [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&adgroup=uxui&device=c&matchtype=e&utm_campaign=ADDICTMOBILE_SKETCH_GAD_DG_UK_T1_ALWAYS-ON_S_TRF_PROS_BRAND&utm_term=sketch&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=TOF_BRND__generic&hsa_acc=8710913982&hsa_cam=16831089317&hsa_grp=134620695759&hsa_ad=592060065319&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-14921750&hsa_kw=sketch&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwr4eYBhDrARIsANPywCjRIFn93DMezYnsyE5Fic_8l8kynJtut0GYMU01TiohHjwziFtlH0gaAhteEALw_wcB) and [Mockup](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockup-sketch-ui-ux/id1527554407) to name just a few! Or you can even go old school and get those wireframes completed using pen and paper. Just snap an image of the completed wireframes to add the images to the README.

## Features

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

I have made every effort to increase the accessibility of the website. I have incorporated various features such as aria-labels for social media icons to enable easy use of screen readers by all individuals. Additionally, I have added a span over the hero background image to enable screen readers to provide a comprehensive description of the content. To ensure further accessibility, I have used semantic HTML throughout the website.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

HTML and CSS were used to create this website.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Balsamiq - Used to create wireframes.

Git - For version control.

Github - To save and store the files for the website.

Bootstrap Version 5.3 - Code for the navigation bar.

Google Fonts - To import the fonts used on the website.

Font Awesome - For the iconography on the website.

Google Dev Tools - To troubleshoot and test features, solve issues with responsiveness and styling.

[Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) To create favicon and mobile bookmark icons.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

### ¬†Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
### ¬†Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
