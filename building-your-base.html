            <h2>The Importance of a Running Base</h2>

            <p>
                Having a strong base is crucial in reducing the risk of injury during training. Overuse injuries are
                particularly common among runners who neglect the importance of building a foundation to their training.
                Studies reveal that increasing your training mileage too quickly is a major cause for concerns of common
                running injuries, such as shin splints, plantar fasciitis, and IT band syndrome.
                However, building a running base for a few months depending on current fitness gives your body enough
                time to adapt to
                the gradual increase in running intensity and load.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Develop a Running Base</h2>

            <p>
                The approach to building a running base can vary depending on the runner's experience and the distance
                they
                would like to cover. For a beginner, a suitable training plan should incorporate walk breaks and
                gradually build the weekly mileage. Intermediate runners may include more extended runs with strides at
                the end of their running miles. Advanced runners can focus on their speed and increase their weekly
                mileage
                as their base fitness improves.
            </p>

            <p>
                Regardless of experience, every runner needs to add strength training exercises to their routine to
                supplement their running. Bodyweight exercises, resistance band exercises, and dumbbell exercises are
                recommended.
            </p>

            <p>
                In conclusion, building a solid running base should not be overlooked regardless of experience level.
                With
                sufficient preparation for your training, you can achieve your goals and dominate your races without the
                risk of succumbing to injuries along the way.
            </p>

            <h2>Beginner Base Training Plan</h2>

            <p>Break up the run and walk intervals however feels comfortable, alternating 2 minutes running with 2
                minutes
                walking. Start around 20 minutes total most days, as indicated below, but work up to 30 minutes total
                most days.
            </p>

            <p>
                Monday: run-walk for 20 min<br>
                Tuesday: strength<br>
                Wednesday: run-walk for 20 min<br>
                Thursday: rest or strength<br>
                Friday: run-walk for 20 min<br>
                Saturday: run-walk for 30 min<br>
                Sunday: rest or strength<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Intermediate Base Training Plan</h2>

            <p>
                Each run should be an easy, conversational effort. But on two days, add four to six strides, with 40-60
                seconds rest between, at the end of your miles. Run your strides at 80 to 90 percent maximum effort at
                the tail end of your run with a focus on smooth and relaxed running form.
            </p>

            <p>
                Monday: run for 30 min + strength<br>
                Tuesday: run for 40 min<br>
                Wednesday: run for 50 min<br>
                Thursday: strength<br>
                Friday: run for 40 min<br>
                Saturday: run for 60 min<br>
                Sunday: rest<br>
            </p>


            <h2>Advanced Base Training Plan</h2>

            <p>
                This plan brings the effort up a bit with some strides at the end of a couple of runs and the option to
                do a
                speed workout one day. But don't push it too hardâ€”save those really intense efforts for once you get
                into your race-training plan.
            </p>

            <p>
                Monday: run easy effort for 45 min + strength<br>
                Tuesday: run easy effort for 50 min with 4-6 strides<br>
                Wednesday: run easy effort for 60 min or fartlek run<br>
                Thursday: run for 45 min + strength<br>
                Friday: run easy effort for 55 min with 4-6 strides<br>
                Saturday: run easy effort for 90 min<br>
                Sunday: rest<br>
            </p>
